The [`contacts.vcf`](./contacts.vcf) contains a list of contacts which can be used for testing. Push it to your emulator using command

```
adb push contacts.vcf /sdcard/contacts.vcf
```

## Push notifications

If you want to use the app with your own server and want push notification to work you have to set them up:

* Register at https://firebase.google.com/, set up the project if you have not done so already.
* [Download your own](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/google-services-plugin) config file `google-services.json` and place it to the `app/` folder of your copy of Tindroid project. The config file contains keys specific to your Firebase/FCM registration.
* Copy Google-provided server key to `tinode.conf`, see details [here](https://github.com/tinode/chat/blob/master/docs/faq.md#q-how-to-setup-fcm-push-notifications).
* Recompile the app. If you add `google-services.json` incorrectly the app will compile but will later crash with non-obvious exceptions.
